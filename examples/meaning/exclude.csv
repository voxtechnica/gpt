When I think of a life that is meaningful, I think of Victor Frankl who described finding meaning in life in the most horrible conditions ever known in a German concentration camp.  It makes me wonder if finding meaning necessarily emerges from encountering hardship and recognizing what makes life worth living and what one has to contribute to the world to make things better.  Because humans are social animals, I imagine that most people find their relationships with others (family, children, partners, community) and sharing hard and good times provides a lot of meaning in life.  For others, it could be devoting their life to their spiritual beliefs, or to a profession or avocation that awakens a part of oneself and contributes to the world in a way that feels significant (science, medicine, art, etc.).  Finding meaning does not require wealth, but I think it is true that many people have wondered if they are wasting their lives in 40+ hour dead end jobs that seem insignificant, repetitive and boring.  I also think that finding meaning is not necessarily about accomplishment.  Frankl would say that the process of looking for meaning is just as important as producing anything specific.  The opposite of ""a meaningful life"" is ""a meaningless life"" which feels antithetic to what being alive is all about.  Non-human animals can also have meaningful lives, in my opinion, by contributing to their species and that of others in myriad ways and probably in ways we will never know about or be able to imagine.

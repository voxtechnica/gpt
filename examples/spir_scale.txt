Your job is to rate the participant's spirituality, based on what they wrote in response to the following prompt: “{{question}}”

The participant wrote the following: “{{answer}}”

I would like you to indicate whether you agree with each of the statements below., using following scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neither agree nor disagree, 5 = slightly agree, 6 = agree, 7 = strongly agree.

A. This person likely feels that on a higher level all of us share a common bond.
B. This person likely feels that there is a higher plane of consciousness or spirituality that binds all people.
C. This person likely feels that although dead, images of some of his/her relatives continue to influence his/her current life.
D. This person likely feels that he or she is a link in the chain of his/her family’s heritage, a bridge between past and future.

Sometimes participants may not write anything that directly or explicitly shows whether the statements are true of them. In such cases, please use your best judgment to make inferences.

Please first indicate your answers to each of these statements separately. Then compute a single composite score by averaging your responses to the four statements. Your response should begin by explaining your assessment, and end with the composite score in this format, "Score: X".
